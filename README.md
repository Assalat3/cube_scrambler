# cube_scrambler
A simple command line scrambler for cubes written in python. Work in progress, will update later.

To-do list:
- Make it impossible to get the same move-set multiple times in a row.
  - Also: No back-to-back moves that counter each other, for example: 2L and 2L, M and M' etc.
- Add scrambles for larger cubes, minxes etc.
- Add a timer?
